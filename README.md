# **Precision Controlled Car with Load**  
*Mini-project demonstrating precision and stability in robotics.*  

---

## **Project Description**  
This project involved designing and implementing a precision-controlled car capable of traveling exactly 1 meter at the press of a control button. The car was built on a 4-wheel platform, integrating key components for wireless control and stability.  

### **Key Features**  
- **Precision Movement**: The car was programmed to move precisely 1 meter with a load of approximately 500 grams.  
- **Wireless Control**: Leveraged NodeMCU-ESP8266 for seamless wireless operation.  
- **Robust Design**: Utilized an L298N motor driver to ensure stability and efficient motor control.  
- **Ease of Use**: Controlled via BlynkIO for a user-friendly interface.
